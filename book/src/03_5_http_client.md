# HTTP Client
Next, we'll write a small client that retrieves data over an HTTP connection to the internet.

## Setup

✅ Go to `intro/http-client` directory.

✅ Open the prepared project skeleton in `intro/http-client`.

✅ Add your network credentials: Set the  `SSID` and `PASSWORD` environment variables-

## Making a connection

By default, only unencrypted HTTP is available, which rather limits our options of hosts to connect to. We're going to use `www.mobile-j.de/`.
