# Software

Follow the steps below for a default installation of the ESP32-C3 platform tooling.

🔎 Should you desire a customized installation (e.g. building parts from source, or adding support for Xtensa targets), instructions for doing so can be found in the [Installation](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html) chapter of the *Rust on ESP* Book.

## Rust toolchain

✅ If you haven't got Rust on your computer, obtain it via <https://rustup.rs/>

Furthermore, for ESP32-C3, a [*nightly* version](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html#working-with-nightly-rust) of the Rust toolchain is currently required, for this training we will use `nightly-2023-11-14` version.

✅ Install *nightly* Rust and add support for the target architecture using the following command:

```console
rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-11-14 --component rust-src --target riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf
```

🔎 Rust is capable of cross-compiling to any supported target (see `rustup target list`). By default, only the native architecture of your system is installed.

## Espressif toolchain

Several tools are required:
- [`cargo-espflash`](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/tree/main/cargo-espflash) - upload firmware to the microcontroller and open serial monitor with cargo integration
- [`espflash`](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/tree/main/espflash) - upload firmware to the microcontroller and open serial monitor

✅ Install them with the following command:

```console
cargo install cargo-espflash espflash
```

⚠️ The `espflash` and `cargo-espflash` commands listed in the book assume version is >= 2

## Toolchain dependencies

### Debian/Ubuntu

```console
sudo apt install llvm-dev libclang-dev clang
```
### macOS

When using the Homebrew package manager, which we recommend:
```console
brew install llvm
```

## Docker

An alternative environment, is to use Docker. The repository contains a `Dockerfile`
with instructions to install the Rust toolchain, and all required packages. **This virtualized environment is designed
to compile the binaries for the Espressif target. Flashing binaries from containers is not possible**, hence there are two options:
- Execute flashing commands, e.g., `cargo-espflash`, on the host system. If proceeding with this option, it's recommended to keep two terminals open:
    - In the container: compile the project
    - On the host: use the `cargo-espflash` sub-command to flash the program onto the embedded hardware
- Use [`web-flash`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-web-flash-server) crate to flash the resulting binaries from the container. The container already includes `web-flash`. Here is how you would flash the build output of [`hello-world` project](./02_4_hello-world.md):
   ```console
   web-flash --chip esp32c3 target/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf/release/hello-world
   ```

✅ Install [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

✅ Get the docker image: There are 2 ways of getting the Docker image:
- Build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`:
    ```console
    docker image build --tag rust-std-training --file .devcontainer/Dockerfile .
    ```
    Building the image takes a while depending on the OS & hardware (20-30 minutes).
- Download it from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/rust-std-training):
    ```console
    docker pull espressif/rust-std-training
    ```
✅ Start the new Docker container:
```console
docker run --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace,consistency=cached -it rust-std-training /bin/bash
```

This starts an interactive shell in the Docker container. It also mounts the local repository to a folder
named `/workspace` inside the container. Changes to the project on the host system are reflected inside the container & vice versa.

## Additional Software

### VS Code

One editor with good Rust support is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is available for most platforms.
When using VS Code, we recommend the following extensions to help during the development.

* [`Rust Analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) to provide code completion & navigation
* `Even Better TOML` for editing TOML based configuration files

There are a few more useful extensions for advanced usage

* [`lldb`](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) a native debugger extension based on LLDB
* [`crates`](https://github.com/serayuzgur/crates) to help manage Rust dependencies

### VS Code & Devcontainer

One extension for VS Code that might be helpful to develop inside a Docker container is [`Remote Containers`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release).
It uses the same `Dockerfile` as the [Docker setup](#docker), but builds the image and connects to it from within VS Code.
Once the extension is installed, VS Code recognizes the configuration in the `.devcontainer` folder. Use the `Remote Containers - Reopen in Container` command to connect VS Code to the container.
